# COVID SQL Project

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to visualize global COVID-19 data. This involved collecting data from reliable sources, processing and cleaning the data, and creating visualizations to provide insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 worldwide. The visualizations aimed to highlight trends, compare statistics across different regions, and track the progression of the pandemic over time.

The first step of this project was to obtain the data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). The second step involved processing and cleaning the data by loading it into a SQL server. SQL was then used to query the data, which was subsequently exported into Tableau for visualization. You can view the visualization below or using the following link: [Parmveerâ€™s Tableau COVID-19 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/parmveer.sohal/viz/COVIDDashboard_17167559581340/Dashboard1).

## Key Learnings

Through the process of obtaining data, querying it using SQL, and visualizing it using Tableau, I gained the following key insights:
*	SQL techniques for data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.
*	Skills in using visualization tools like Tableau to create informative charts and graphs.
*	The importance of choosing appropriate visualization types to effectively convey different kinds of data.
*	Insights into the challenges of working with real-world data, including dealing with missing values and data inconsistencies.
*	A deeper understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 through data analysis and visualization.
